# Chapter 12: Recursion

### 12.5  writeBinary
This program uses a recursive method that has an integer as a parameter. It takes the integer and converts it to binary. The integer parameter of 44 would give a binary output of 101100.

### 12.12 isReverse
This program uses a recursive method that has two strings as its parameter. If the two strings are the same but one is in the opposite direction, we get an output of true. It does not matter if the strings are capitalized, the program will still run. We get an output of false if the strings do not match. For example, "hello" and "olLeH" would return true but "hello" and "ih" would return false.

### 12.17 permut
This program uses a recursive method that has two integer parameters n and r. The program computes the formula p(n, r) = n!(n-r)!. For example, the input p(6, 5) will give the output of 720. 

### 12.22 subsets
This program uses a recursive method that accepts a list of strings as a parameter. The program will compute every sub-list possible that could be created from the strings in the list. For example an input of "Janet", "Char" would have an output of:
[Janet, Char]
[Janet]
[Char]
[]
